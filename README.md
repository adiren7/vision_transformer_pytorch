# Vision Transformer (ViT) Model from Scratch

This repository contains a Vision Transformer (ViT) model implementation from scratch. The notebook and Python script provided walk through the key components of the ViT architecture, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the model's construction and functionality.

## Files in the Repository

- `vit.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that explores the components of the Vision Transformer model step-by-step, with explanations and visualizations.
- `vit.py`: Python script that contains the complete implementation of the Vision Transformer model, ready to use for image classification tasks.

## Vision Transformer Overview

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a powerful model architecture that leverages the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to process image data. The ViT divides an image into a sequence of patches and applies a transformer to these patches for classification.

### Key Components

1. **Patch Embedding**: Converts image patches into a sequence of linear embeddings.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the patch embeddings.
3. **Transformer Encoder**: Consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.
4. **Classification Head**: Transforms the output embeddings into class predictions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    Open `vit.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to follow along with the model creation process and visualize the intermediate outputs.

3. **Use the Python script**:
    The `vit.py` script can be directly run to train and evaluate the Vision Transformer model on your dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
